A 4-bit Led Digital Tube Module simple to use library
Developed for the cheap and popular 7-segment 4 digits led displays based on two TM74HC595 (or similar) shift registers, the main focus was set in ease of use, flexibility and basic prevention of 'misrepresentation' errors, so that if a value can't be faithfully represented by the display, it won't be showed at all, and the method will return a false flag.
