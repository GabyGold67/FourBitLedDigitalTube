#**A 4-bit Led Digital Tube Module simple to use library**
Developed for the cheap and popular 7-segment 4 digits led displays based on two TM74HC595 (or similar) shift registers, the main focus was set in ease of use, flexibility and basic prevention of 'misrepresentation' errors, so that if a value can't be faithfully represented by the display, the methods will return a false value. Methods for displaying gauges "Old Motorola brick cell phones" style are included.
