sentence=7 segment, 1 to 8 digits LED display easy to use and powerful library for modules based on two 74HC595 (or similar) shift registers chips.
paragraph=Developed originally for the cheap and popular '4-bit Led Digital Tube Module', extended for the various models from 1 to 8 digits, (and for all the custom made displays as: GIANTS COUNTERS, TIMERS, PRICING DISPLAYS, etc.) based on two 74HC595 (or similar) shift registers, the main focus was set on: ease of use, flexibility and basic prevention of 'misrepresentation' errors. Now includes on-line simulations for most of the example files (simulator provided by WOKWI.com)
